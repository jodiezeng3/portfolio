<h1>Web Scraping Project</h1>

<p>Goal was to be able to scrape data from the ESPN website to put the NHL standings into a CSV file type and then manipulate that data to see what the NHL standings would look like with a different point system (3 points for a regulation win, 2 points for an overtime or shootout win, 1 point for an overtime or shootout loss, 0 points for a regulation loss). Scraped the data using python libraries (pandas, selenium, beautiful soup) and then Google Sheets.</p>

<p>First, I completed the linked web scraping tutorial to learn the basics of web scraping.</p>
<p>Then worked on trying to parse through the tables on ESPN. This was a little more complicated since the data is in tables and each type of statistic is nested inside a table.</p> 
<p>Finally, I manipulated the resulting CSV in Google Sheets to calculate the neseccary data to recalculate the standings with the adjusted point system. To do this, I first had to calculate the regulation losses and overtime wins for each team. Then I calculated the adjusted total points for each team and used those form the new league rankings. I then calculated the change in the standings by subtracting the original standings from the adjusted stangings. By doing this, any team that moved up in the league rankings would have a positive change while those who dropped would have a negative change. I then added a row to show the change in the point totals. I also added columns to display the original point percentage of each team and the adjusted point percentage of each team. This was done by dividing the total points for each system by the total number of points they could have gotten if they had won all of those games in regulation.</p>
<p>From there, I worked to create simple visualizations to present the data in a visually pleasing way. To do this I created a pivot table in another sheet and used the table to create three different charts. First, I graphed the original point % of each team against the adjusted point % and created a trendline. This can help us compare the two different models. The next chart I created graphed the original point % and the adjusted point % on a scatter plot with the x-axis being each different team. This allows us to see how the two different point systems affect each team. If the dots are on top of each other, the different systems wouldn't change the percentage of points that team would get per game. If the dots are far apart, then there is a greater difference in their point percentages. We would likely see this greater difference in teams that tend to win more in overtime or shootouts than in regulation, since the adjusted point model rewards teams for winning in regulation. The last chart I created graphed the change in a team's place in the standings. This lets us visualize who would benefit the most from a change in how the NHL calculates points. While the average change in a team's place in the standings was a 0.0625 increase, two teams greatly exceeded that average. The Edmonton Oilers and Florida Panthers would greatly benefit from a change in point system as they would move up in the standings 5 and 3 places respectively. The greatest move down the standings was only two places. The New York Rangers, Pittsburgh Penguins, and Vancouver Canucks all saw their point percentages drop by around 0.060 and droped two places in the standings. These three teams and the seven others that droped one place in the standings show a greater difference between their original and adjusted point percentages than those teams who had the same place in the standings or moved up. All of this work is displayed in the nhl-standings-3-28-23 PDF in this folder.</p>
