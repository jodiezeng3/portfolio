<h1>Download Project</h1>
<p>In this project, I created a simple HTTP client that can download files from a simple server (Carnegie Mellon University's <a href="http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/students.html">tiny web server</a> - see the bottom of the linked page under chapter 12). In this project, we explored socket programing, file I/O, string manipulation, pointers, and more.</p>
