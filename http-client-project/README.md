<h1>Download Project</h1>
<p>In this project, I created a simple HTTP Client that connects to a <a href="http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/tiny.tar">simple server</a> and is able to download files from that server.</p>
<p>This project focuses on socket programming, string manipulation, file I/O, and more</p>
