<h1>CSC 262 Computational Statistics Final Project</h1>
<p>This final project had us pair with anoher student to divide a set of 7 questions. Shown in the two PDFs are the questions and the answers to my selected questions from my group: 5, 6, and 7.</p>
<p>After completing all the questions, me and my partner went over each others work to check for any errors and to make sure we fully understood each concept.</p>
